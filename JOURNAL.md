# Current Total Time Worked On Project: 27.9 Hours

# 5/22/2025 Log 1: The Start

I set up my repo, the Fusion 360 docs, and the other documents I am using to track my project's development. Then I cobbled together some various parts from CAD of different projects and made a mockup of what it could look like:

Later today, I will disassemble two scrap printers and then take the parts and lay them out to see how I could optimize the frame and the metal parts that I have to work with, then I can get down to real CAD.

Time Spent: 40 Minutes

# 5/22/2025 Log 2: Extrusion Are Just Big Legos

I started by finishing disassembling my 3d printers and cleaning up my workshop, then laying out my extrusion and getting an idea of how the frame should look. I decided on a rough frame here:![IMG_6851](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89484311-25e3-4263-b618-e1a2b4bf3a2b)

Now that I have the frame, it is time to get to CAD!

Time Spent: 2 hours

# 5/22/2025 Log 3: Getting Basic Parts

I started getting the CAD file organised. I made a folder in Fusion 360 and then referenced other CAD files for ideas and inspiration. I then started to collect basic part CAD files from the internet for the printer frame, using the LH Stinger BOM as a basic list of parts. This technique of using the internet to find premade models for parts like aluminum extrusions, screws, and other things can speed up the CAD process.

Time Spent: 1.5 hours

# 5/24/2025 Log 4: Frame Designed!

I built the frame in Fusion 360 and found that you can get CAD files of parts you can order on: https://us.misumi-ec.com/. I then started getting the file organised so I can hopefully create a BOM natively in Fusion 360.

# 5/27/2025 Log 5: Finally Some Progress!

After a little break (I had a four-day swim meet), I finally hopped back onto the project. I want to say that not everything in this project was fully created and done by yours truly alone; I am using some bits and bobs from the LH Stinger design. And the metal parts that you would buy are industrial CAD parts from the internet. So the Y axis and the X axis are currently not my design. I will likely modify them to my needs and aesthetic preferences, but why try to fix something that isn’t broken? I am also creating a really organised file for the Ship, and hopefully, I can create some videos and an animated build manual for future makers of this printer!

How the printer currently looks:

Time Spent: 3.5 Hours

# 5/28/2025 Log 6: Adding More Parts
Today, I added more parts to the 3d printer, most notably the dual Z-belted system from the LH Stinger. I am also preparing for the part where I shine: toolhead design! I sent an email to Dimitri, the Picolino extruder guy, and hopefully, he will send me the CAD files I requested. I also created a sketch of some ideas for the toolhead and the project’s logo on some graph paper: 

![Sketch of Toolhead](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f1840ae-c282-4bdf-b204-84e20d0e965e)


I really want to go all out on this toolhead, I am aiming for under 500 grams, but with insane cooling, integrated PCB, one cable back to the mainboard, support for 4 color printing, a watercooled metal extruder block, and maybe even have the heatsink combined with the extruder itself! I would like to add RGB accents to the logo on the toolhead and some recessed details as well. 

This is how the printer currently looks:

# 5/28/2025 Log 7: Finally Starting to Look Like A Printer!
Today I added more parts, I also modified some parts. I am quickly approaching the point where now on, the CAD will be made solely by me. I added a basic placeholder toolhead and am getting the MISC parts located and positioned.
Also I my Bambu Labs order arrived, I got a roll of CF-PLA, A roll of CF-PETG, and four rolls of basic PLA, along with an engineering plate and a 0.6 hardened steel nozzle. The CF filament is for printing the parts for the machine! And the accessories for being able to print the plastic. I also organised a vast amount of parts in my workshop and cleaned up quite a bit! Here is a photo dump of the day's activities:

# 5/29/2025 and 6/2/2025 Log 8: Toolhead Shtuff!
These past days, I have been hard at work CAD'ing and physically building things. To start off, I scoured the internet for the toolhead files I required for a ultra combined version that will blow you away (I hope, since I have not made it yet). I part sorted loads of screws, organised my workshop fully, geared up my printer to print Carbon Fiber infused filimants, and printed and built (mostly) my plan B toolhead. 
You may ask: "What is a Plan B toolhead?" Well, my projects are often ambitious, and so I have purposely integrated failsafes into my plan for this project. So I have my Plan A toolhead, a wild but super cool toolhead design, but if I am not able to finish the toolhead design in time, I have a still cool Plan B toolhead. THAT is the one I built today. I also experimented with getting cleaner toop surfaces on my 3d prints and my logo (Sanding, and Slicer optimization).

# 6/4/25 and 6/3/25 and 6/2/25 Log 9 Toolhead Starting To Look Toolhead-y?

These last few days have been me just grinding cad, trying to combine Kevin's current world record toolhead with the Lh Stinger toolhead and creating my own oringinal BEAST! It currently doesnt look like much but it has been a LOT of work: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b62cd70-33fc-4266-a21e-332268dfde02)

I spent time in the Roadtrip call as well while CADDing.

Time spent 8 hours
