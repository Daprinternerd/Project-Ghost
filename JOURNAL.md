I set up my repo, the Fusion 360 docs, and the other documents I am using to track my project's development. Then I cobbled together some various parts from CAD of different projects and made a mockup of what it could look like: ![Screenshot 2025-05-22 072858](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517e3725-991b-43a0-8b9b-5d0a9e3d8069)

Later today, I will disassemble two scrap printers and then take the parts and lay them out to see how I could optimize the frame and the metal parts that I have to work with, then I can get down to real CAD.

Time Spent: 40 Minutes
