# Ghost 1
I'm building a custom, ultra-fast Cartesian 3D printer using salvaged parts to break the sub-3-minute Benchy world record. Inspired by top community mods and open-source tools, itâ€™ll feature multi-material support and a sleek design, documented for others to build too.

Here is how it looks currently:
